# Telegram Reporter DoorBell

The simplest use case for this project is the doorbell to telegram messenger.
This would pick up the 433 MHz signal from the doorbell push button
and send a message via telegram to be picked up on a mobile phone.
This could be extended using MQTT to track doorbell presses, and make actions happen within node-red.
This use case would allow existing cricket 3 PCB designs and hardware to be used(reused).

This project is created with the help of chatGPT.
