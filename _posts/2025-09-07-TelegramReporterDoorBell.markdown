# Telegram Reporter DoorBell

The simplest use case for this project is the doorbell to telegram messenger.
This would pick up the 433 MHz signal from the doorbell push button
and send a message via telegram to be picked up on a mobile phone.
This could be extended using MQTT to track doorbell presses, and make actions happen within node-red.
This use case would allow existing cricket 3 PCB designs and hardware to be used(reused).

This project is created with the help of chatGPT.

The doorbell unit is positioned close to the Wi-Fi 6 router, a POE supply with a buck converter supplies 12V to both units.

The doorbell  internally uses a 12V to 5V converter taken from a car cigar lighter socket USB converter sold for Â£1 in Poundland.
This converter is an afterthought, that is why it is glued to the underside of th PCB.

This unit also has a test button, that makes a doorbell press message to be sent to Telegram.


can be used to check that Telegram messages are being transmitted/received.
