<!-- outline-start -->

This board is principally designed to hold a 32700 sized battery in place, and make electrical contact with it.
For some reason battery holders for this battery are either not available, or are unsuitable.
The 32700 naming convention equate to 32mm diameter, and 70mm long (why extra zero?).

As a PCB was being manufactured for this purpose, I (as always) decided to make it multipurpose, by adding some
resistor signal conditioning, and by adding prototyping areas to the board.
The board does also have a cut-out to cater for a barrel-jack connector, to allow the battery to be charged in-situ.

#### PCB as designed

The PCB is designed as a 1.6mm thick board, double sided through hole plated.
Provision for SOT or axial resistors is provided.
The PCB is designed as a supplementary board to a main board with a micro-controller fitted.

#### PCB Housing

The case is a standard Chinese 115x90x55 plastic box.
The battery board and main board are stacked in pillars, and the LiFePO4 battery is sandwiched between them.
This view of the case shows the 3.5mm soket fitted, which will later be used to charge the battery.

#### Soldering Steps

The battery clips are difficult to solder. For a good contact with the battery
the clip needs to sit proud of the PCB. Fitting the clip and using a small wire to hold 
the clip in place when the board is upside down was found to make the soldering/assembly
process much easier, as the clip automatically fell into alignment.

The 3.5mm socket can be pre-fitted to the board, and soldered in-place, then it needs to
installed in it's socket, at the same time as the board is fitted on it's mounting screws.

#### Fitting Components

The -ve clip with it's spring does experience a lot of force when the battery is fitted, 
this causes it to bend, so a plastic filler is used to support the clip, and help mantain
pressure on the battery.

The pillars will then need to be fitted to support the main PCB.
A single 3.3V connection is made between the two boards.

The main board may optionally have an external DS18B20 external temperature probe.

Many of the batteries I have do not have a plastic sleeve, on these patteries I've
placed an insulating strip along the top of the battery to block contact with the underside
or the Cricket PCB.

#### Assembled Cricket Module

THe 3.3V connection attaches to the main board via its J4 connector,
0V = Pin 1, 3.3V = Pin 4.

The Spacers for the pillars between boards is ???

More Information on the Cricket2 project can be found in the relevant blog entries.

**Keep it simple**, the Cricket 2 modules are designed to have a minimum battery life of 3 months between recharges.
That is based on the module doing a transmission every Â½ hour, so 2 x 24 x 92 transmission approx 3500 transmissions.
