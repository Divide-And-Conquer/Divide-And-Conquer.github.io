<!-- outline-start -->

This board is principally designed to hold a 32700 sized battery in place, and make electrical contact with it.
For some reason battery holders for this battery are either not available, or are unsuitable.
The 32700 naming convention equate to 32mm diameter, and 70mm long (why extra zero?).

As a PCB was being manufactured for this purpose, I (as always) decided to make it multipurpose, by adding some
resistor signal conditioning, and by adding prototyping areas to the board.
The board does also have a cut-out to cater for a barrel-jack connector, to allow the battery to be charged in-situ.

#### PCB as designed.

The PCB is designed as a 1.6mm thick board, double sided through hole plated.
Provision for SOT or axial resistors is provided.
The PCB is designed as a supplementary board to a main board with a micro-controller fitted.

#### PCB Housing.

The case is a standard Chinese 115x90x55 plastic box.
The battery board and main board are stacked in pillars, and the LiFePO4 battery is sandwiched between them.
This view of the case shows the 3.5mm soket fitted, which will later be used to charge the battery.

More Information on the Cricket2 project can be found in the relevant blog entries.

**Keep it simple**, the Cricket 2 modules are designed to have a minimum battery life of 3 months between recharges.
That is based on the module doing a transmission every Â½ hour, so 2 x 24 x 92 transmission approx 3500 transmissions.
