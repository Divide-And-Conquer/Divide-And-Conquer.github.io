# Outline

This project uses the case and various components from a All in one AW 01 Yale camera.
This camera was purchased on eBay with a known fault, essentially the Wi-fi did not work, 
and on investigation was seen to be unrealistic to repair.

The aim of this project is to see how much of the original broken Yale Camera can be reused and made useful, perhaps even returning it to being a full security working camera.

```
  What components from the Yale unit can be reused?
    - housing and mounting bracket
    - External PSU (not for this camera)
    - camera 
    - IR LEDs
    - speaker / siren
    - microphone
    - spotlight
    - Information LEDs
    - PIR (motion detection)
    - SD card
```

These components range in complexity, e.g. Leds should be simple to drive, but the camera would be very challenging to reuse.

One serious difficulty when building your own camera is finding a suitable housing, especially one that can be mounted externally. This is even more troublesome if the housing has to contain any extras (microphone/speaker/siren/PIR/second camera), the Yale camera unit has provision for these.

Sourcing a housing is difficult but you may also be able to obtain one on eBay as a damaged of failed unit.

# Hardware Investigation

The hardware in this unit is quite sophisticated, internally it contains 4 purpose built PCBs, these contain surface mount components and are connected using ribbon and discrete cables, .

The passive infrared (PIR) sensor is housed on its own PCB

The rest of the electronics is on 3 PCBS Linked with ribbon cables

LED driver board provides spotlight, IR LEDs, Information LEDs

Main board provides CPU, Storage, Camera.

Interface board provides SD card, Wifi including Aerials

```
                                             
# Design Notes

Other than the case itself, the first good candidate for reuse would appear to be the LED driver board (spotlight, IR LEDs, Information LEDs). these are driven via a ribbon cable, it will be necessary to identify the signals in the ribbon cable and to hook up to it.

The speaker / siren and microphone, but also appear to be good candidates.

The PIR sensor on its on the PCB is a possibility, but will require the signal interface to be determined.

A CPU module will have to be piggybacked onto a custom PCB.

The PCB for this project is designed to fit in place of the original PCB, and to use it's mounting points.

The main camera is a RPi 5 module with a carrier camera.

# Connector Pin assignments

These pin numbers are the original pin numbers/functions from the Yale Camera, the Wire colour column is not original but details the colours used with the new cables installed on the reworked camera.
