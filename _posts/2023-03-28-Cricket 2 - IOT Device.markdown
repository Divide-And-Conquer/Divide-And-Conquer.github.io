The original Cricket was a commercial project product made by the things on edge company based in Cambridge.
This device monitored it's own battery, temperature, and had a few inputs for measuring other external 
parameters. It then sent this monitored information to a server computer using MQTT. The original device
was simple to deploy, low cost, and had a good battery life.

The company produced two versions of the cricket device but unfortunately went out of business.
The version one device of theirs was configured via the internet and became unmodifiedable so was difficult to use
for further development. As some of these devices just stopped working!

The version 2 device could still be reconfigured.

Both devices kept in use for a number of months while whilst I came up with the design for the Cricket 2 replacement board. 

This project is based on a PCB designed for a previous project of mine called scheduler 
So the PCB has been reused and it's quite suitable for the cricket to project Mulan 
 

Some changes / additions have been made with this implementation,

> Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks

> If this be error and upon me proved,
