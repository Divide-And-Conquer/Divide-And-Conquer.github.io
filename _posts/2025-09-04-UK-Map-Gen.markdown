# UK map image generator

This application is used to generate a map of the UK showing counties
and routes walked within them counties, the resulting uk_map.png file,
his intended call from within a web page, and viewable online.
This tool is quite capable of generating maps for any country, not just the UK.

A strong point of this tool, is that the entire map is rendered from data,
and that the Python scripts can be rerun and global changes implemented.
This is viewed as better than an editor, where an image can be tweaked, but then never regenerated.

The boundary information is originally sourced from
https://csmale.dev.openstreetmap.org/os_boundaryline_202405/index.html

```
  These programs run on a home PC
  sources to generate the uk_map.png map can be found in
  
  P:\DevelopmentCode\Python\AllCountiesWalks
  
  Open a cmd window and navigate to this directory, to build everything run 
    python generate_counties_info.py
  and 
    python generate_uk_map.py
  
  Or more typically just run
    python generate_uk_map.py
  to update the walks

  It should finish with the message
  ✅ Map saved as uk_map.png at ~9000 x 9000 pixels

  if you DO run under powershell, to avoid any error messages first run
  chcp 65001

```

Two separate Python files are used to generate the uk_map.png file,

### - generate_counties_info.py
```
    Builds a set of vectors which detail the boundary limits, boundary names and positioning of those names,
    these are stored in a file called counties.geojson
    It uses a file boundary_hints.csv, which provides boundary names and positioning of those names.
    This takes time to run and is viewed as an infrequent action.
```

### - generate_uk_map.py
```
    It uses the output from the first,
    and overlays on it a set of routes already walked held in .\routes_walked , 
    and routes planned to be walked held in .\routes_to_be_walked
```

This is illustrated below:

### Example boundary_hints.csv file

```
# Expected folder structure:
#
#     ./historic_counties_gpx   -> GPX files for county borders
#     ./routes_walked           -> GPX files for walking routes
#     boundary_hints.csv        -> CSV with filename and label positioning hints
#
# justification – affects horizontal alignment of the text:
#
# L → left
# R → right
# C → center
#
# horizontal – determines horizontal position of the label within the county boundary:
#
# L → left
# R → right
# M → middle
#
# vertical – determines vertical position of the label within the county boundary:
#
# T → top
# M → middle
# B → bottom
#
# filename                  , boundary_colour , justification, horizontal, vertical,  text_colour,  text_background
