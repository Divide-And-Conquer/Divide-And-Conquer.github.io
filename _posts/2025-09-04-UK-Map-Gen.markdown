# UK map image generator

This application is used to generate a map of the UK showing counties
and routes walked within them counties, the resulting complete_map.png file,
his intended call from within a web page, and viewable online.
This tool is quite capable of generating maps for any country, not just the UK.

A strong point of this tool, is that the entire map is rendered from data,
and that the Python scripts can be rerun and global changes implemented.
This is viewed as better than an editor, where an image can be tweaked, but then never regenerated.

sources to generate the uk_map.png map can be found in

P:\DevelopmentCode\Python\AllCountiesWalks

Two separate Python files are used to generate the uk_map.png file,

# The first - generate_counties_info.py
<pre> ```
    Builds a set of vectors which detail the boundary limits, boundary names and positioning of those names,
    these are stored in a file called counties.geojson
    It uses a file boundary_hints.csv, which provides boundary names and positioning of those names.
    This takes time to run and is viewed as an infrequent action.
``` </pre>

# The second - generate_uk_map.py
<pre> ```
    It uses the output from the first,
    and overlays on it a set of routes already walked held in .\routes_walked , 
    and routes planned to be walked held in .\routes_to_be_walked
``` </pre>

This is illustrated below:
