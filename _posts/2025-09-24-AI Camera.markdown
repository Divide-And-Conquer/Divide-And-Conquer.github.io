<!-- outline-start -->

# Outline

This project uses an Grove Vision AI v2 board that is trained to recognise cats, the board can trigger a cat deterrent, such as a smell.

Todo: show  complete unit.

<!-- outline-end -->

# Design Notes

Todo: use a product such as airwick, that is battery powered, to provide the pong, replace battery with DC from unit power, prove toggling DC activates pong.
Todo: prove airwick acts as a deterent.

Todo: How to power this unit, do battery tests? or just go straight for mains power

Todo: Prove Grove Vision AI v2 board model can recognise cats

Todo: show Schematic

# PCB

The PCB has been produced using KiCAD 9.0

# Build Notes

Todo: House in a transparent plastic box

# Operation Notes

Todo: Siting of the unit is important, it needs to be near a regular cat walk way.
