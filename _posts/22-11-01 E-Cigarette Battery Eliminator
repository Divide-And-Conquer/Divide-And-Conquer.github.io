<!-- outline-start -->

This is an idea for re-purposing two old torches purchased from poundland (yes, for a Â£1 each).
The torches are simple but sturdy, of good size, so allow ample room for batteries/electronics.

#### Disposable E-Cigarettes

All disposable E-Cigarettes contain a Battery that can be salvaged.
Some are much easier to salavage than others, these are the only ones that i'd suggest you ought to te=ry to use!

#### E-Cigarette Battery Eliminator

The case of the  torch(es) are well made, and have ample space for upgrading / rework.

**Keep it simple**, replace the small incandescent bulb with an LED, 
this will be driven directly by XXX Lithium batteries, try to keep the mounting of these batteries simple.
A protection / driver module will be required.
Keep the single button for ON/OFF operation.
Add a recharge connector in the handle.
